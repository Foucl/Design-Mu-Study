-   with an ITI of 2500 ms, the duration of each trial amounts to **6800 ms** (with the default SOA of 1800 ms)
    -   A shorter SOA (900 ms) yields a total trial duration of **5900 ms**

### Factors<a id="orgheadline3"></a>

-   Manipulated factors (within subject)
    -   **Expression:** Two target emotions of different valence (e.g. *Happy* vs. *Angry*) [\*80 Trials / Expression\*]
    -   **Validity:** congruence of Prime and Target Stimulus or Prime and Response (*valid* vs. *invalid*) [75% of trials valid]
-   those yield the four 'basic' conditions present in each Response Priming experiment
-   we will additionally manipulate:
    -   **Stimulus Type:** *Faces* vs. *Inverted Faces* vs. *Letters*
    -   **SOA:** Difference in time between Prime and Target Stimulus Onset (*long* (1800 ms) vs. *short* (900 ms))
-   Fully crossed, such a **2<sup>3</sup>x3** factorial design would yield 24 conditions and a total runtime of about **102 minutes**
-   We will thus opt for an **incomplete** (or reduced)  **factorial design**, manipulating the SOA only in the StimType-Faces Conditions:
    -   this reduces the number of conditions to 16 and the length of the experiment to about **70 minutes**
    -   this design will **not** be balanced and thus cannot be described as a 2<sup>3-1</sup>x3 fractional factorial design
    -   all main effects will be confounded by interaction effects involving SOA
