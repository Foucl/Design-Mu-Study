## Basic Ideas<a id="orgheadline1"></a>

-   Mu and simulation are related
-   A pronounced ERD in mu signals 'simulative' aspects of one of at least three processes:
    -   action observation
    -   action preparation
    -   action execution
-   Simulation 'entrenches' these processes, presumably making it more difficult to â€¦
    -   inhibit them,
    -   switch (attention) to other actions / stimuli or prepare for them
-   We want to manipulate the 'simulation characteristics' of the stimuli to investigate these assumptions
-   In Response Priming speak, this means: the more 'simulative' the task / prime stimulus
    -   the larger the congruency effect and
    -   the more pronounced the mu component

-   It is likely that ERD in Alpha (even in central regions) will be influenced by spatial attention
