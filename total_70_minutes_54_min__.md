-   total: 70 minutes (54 min SOA<sub>long</sub>, 16 min SOA<sub>short</sub>)
-   blockwise:
    -   Faces: 34 minutes
    -   Inverted Faces: 18 minutes
    -   Letters: 18 Minutes
-   total length without Inverted Faces: 52 minutes
-   total length without inverted Faces, with full factorial design: 68 minutes

## Expected Simple Effects<a id="orgheadline8"></a>

### Behavioral: congruency effect (RT & accuracy)<a id="orgheadline6"></a>

We expect interactions between Validity and StimType as well as Validity and SOA with regard to the congruency effect (RT(invalid) - RT(valid)). The expected contrasts are as follows:

-   Faces > Inverted Faces > Letters (in SOA<sub>long</sub>)
-   SOA<sub>short</sub> > SOA<sub>long</sub> (in StimType<sub>faces</sub>)

### Neuronal (ERD in mu band)<a id="orgheadline7"></a>

-   Faces > Inverted Faces > Letters
-   SOA<sub>short</sub> > SOA<sub>long</sub>

## Additional Exploratory Lines of Questioning<a id="orgheadline9"></a>

-   Interactions between SOA and Expression
-   Interindividual Differences in mu ERD (& rebound)?
-   pre-Stimulus mu ERD as predictor of speed/accuracy on single-trial-level?
-   Chronometry of mu ERD (and its relation to expression/valence)

## Open Questions<a id="orgheadline10"></a>

-   Choice of Target Signal:
    -   perceptual difference to Prime?
    -   identical signal in each StimType condition?
-   Perceptual equivalence of stimuli (esp. StimType<sub>Faces</sub> and StimType<sub>Letters</sub>)
-   Impossible to disassociate 'sources' or 'types' of simulation causing mu ERDs
    -   observation vs. preparation vs. attentional shifts
    -   increased task difficulty increases mu ERD (attentional demands)
-   effect of StimType due to different task demands? (reading/symbolic mapping in Letters condition, coding of emotional facial expression in Faces condition; inverted faces might need to be rotated mentally)
-   strategy for identifying mu components
-   strategy for quantifying strength of mu ERD
-   â€¦
